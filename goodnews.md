![Good news!](https://github.com/HLS-PGR-newsletter/HLS-PGR-newsletter.github.io/blob/master/img/Goodnews.png?raw=true "Good news!")

On this page we will try and keep an up-to-date list of all the achievements made by HLS post-graduates. From PRP passes and competition wins, to publications and press releases, we will collate a list here for you all. 

Even if you have some non-research based good news (Passed a test? Competed in a music or sport event?), let us know and people can see what else our post-graduates have been up to!
