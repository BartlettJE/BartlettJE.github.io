## Available Tasks

I have built several experiments using OpenSesame and PsychoPy for my PhD and for undergraduates to use in their dissertation projects. You may find it useful to adapt one of the cognitive tasks I have built for your own research. You can download them from the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/awjcn/).  

The current list of available tasks is: 
- Go-NoGo Task (OpenSesame)
- Eriksen Flanker Task (OpenSesame)
- Dot Probe Task (OpenSesame and PsychoPy) 
- Anti-Saccade Task (PsychoPy) 

## Recommended Resources

Despite being a useful skill for different areas of research, it is suprisingly difficult to find good resources on learning to build experiments. Here is a collection of resources I have found particularly useful:
- [How to build an Eriksen Flanker](https://www.marsja.se/opensesame-how-to-create-a-flanker-task/) task by Erik Marsja (blog post)
