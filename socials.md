PhD students can fall into the trap of thinking you have work 24/7. However, for the good of yourself and your PhD, it is important to regularly have time to yourself! Be sure to join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/424374727943571/) to stay up to date with all our upcoming social events. 

If you have any questions regarding our social events, please email [Brad Salisbury-Finch](mailto:cov.pgrnewsletter+events@gmail.com).
