## **Thesis title**

Behavioural and neurochemical mechanisms of social bonding during religious rituals: The role of synchrony and endogenous opioids

## **In 50 words, explain your thesis for dummies**

What exactly makes people feel like they are close to each other? Do religious rituals do anything special to make this feeling happen more easily? People aren't sure about either question, so I'm going to try and find out.

## **What advice would you give yourself in the first three months of your PhD?**

## **Why did you choose your thesis topic?**

Expect to do a lot more reading and a lot less writing than you anticipated in your first few months. Don't panic. Stay calm, and get a small bit of work done each day. I promise you, it is entirely normal to feel disoriented and like you aren't accomplishing much early on. You aren't alone in that feeling, so don't beat yourself up over it. 

## **What book or article do you recommend that every PhD student should read?**

Phantoms in the Brain by V.S. Ramachandran. Not only is it a fascinating book that helped spark my desire to go into research science growing up, but Ramachandran also shows how even some of the most seemingly complicated research problems can have simple solutions to them, with a bit of creativity.
