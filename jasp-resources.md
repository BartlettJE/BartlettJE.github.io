JASP is an open-source statistics package designed to make Bayesian statistics accessible. The package is very user-friendly and is perfect for introducing students to statistics with its minimalist design and continuously updated output. You can download it for free from their [website](https://jasp-stats.org/). 

## Introduction to JASP 

I am in the process of writing a guide to transition students from using SPSS to JASP. You can access both the [guide](https://osf.io/p2hzg/) and the [data sets](https://osf.io/7x8hj/) I used for the examples on the Open Science Framework. The sourcing of the data sets are credited to Kevin McIntyre who made them available on the [Open Stats Lab](https://sites.trinity.edu/osl). 

The guide covers the following topics: 
- How to navigate around JASP
- Getting basic descriptive statistics and plots
- Assessing parametric assumptions 
- Conducting independent and paired samples T-Tests 
- Calculating the correlation between two variables
- One-way repeated measures and independent samples ANOVA 
- Bayesian paired samples T-Test

Feel free to use it yourself or in your teaching. If you have any feedback (positive or negative) feel free to contact me.
