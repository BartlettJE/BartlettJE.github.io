Iâ€™m James Bartlett, a PhD student in Psychology at Coventry University, UK.

I am extremely vocal about open science, so in time I will include details of my research, share materials and data, and include any null results that have not been published elsewhere.

Research is difficult and there are many things that I wish I was told earlier, or worked out for myself sooner. My aim here is to share some useful tips that you may not be aware of, or just provide an account of my experiences.

The content of this website will mainly consist of:

- Research methods and statistics
- Tutorials
- Post-graduate student experiences
- My research
- Tips for conducting research
